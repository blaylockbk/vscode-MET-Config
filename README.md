> My first ever VS Code extension üòÅ inspired by [vscode-cylc](https://github.com/cylc/vscode-cylc), [mplstyle](https://github.com/yy0931/vscode-mplstyle), and [magic-python](https://github.com/MagicStack/MagicPython). This is not an extension developed by [DTC](https://dtcenter.org/community-code/model-evaluation-tools-met). I'm just a MET user.

# About

MET Config is a VS Code extension for basic syntax highlighting for Model Evaluation Tools (MET) [configuration files](https://met.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Users_Guide/config_options.html).

As an alternative, you could just use the [C/C++ Themes](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools) because the syntax is similar enough.

- Will highlight files that have the extension `.metconfig`
- Will highlight files with the following names:

```
"filenamePatterns": [
          "PointStatConfig*",
          "GridStatConfig*",
          "EnsembleStatConfig*",
          "MODEAnalysisConfig*",
          "PB2NCConfig*",
          "STATAnalysisConfig*",
          "WaveletStatConfig*"
        ],
```

- vscode can autodect the language in a file (wonder how good this works??)
- You can manually set the file association in the settings

```json
"files.associations": {
    "PointStatConfig.txt": "met-config",
    "GridStatConfig.txt": "met-config",
}
```

## Install

Until I figure out how to publish this on the VS Code marketplace, you should just clone this repository and put the folder into your `.vscode/extensions` folder.
