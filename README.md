# VS Code: MET Config


Basic syntax highlighting for Model Evaluation Tools (MET) config files.

- Will highlight files that have the extension `.metconfig`
- Will highlight files with the following names: 
```
"filenamePatterns": [
          "PointStatConfig*",
          "GridStatConfig*",
          "EnsembleStatConfig*",
          "MODEAnalysisConfig*",
          "PB2NCConfig*",
          "STATAnalysisConfig",
          "WaveletStatConfig"
        ],
```

- vscode can autodect the language in a file (wonder how good this works??)
- You can manually set the file association in the settings

```json
"files.associations": {
    "PointStatConfig.txt": "met-config",
    "GridStatConfig.txt": "met-config",
}
```

## Install
Until I figure out how to publish this on the VS Code marketplace, you should just clone this repository and put the folder into your `.vscode/extensions` folder.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:
